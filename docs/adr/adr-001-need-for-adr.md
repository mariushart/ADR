# Need for Architecture Decision Records

## Metadata
- ID: ADR-001
- Type: ADR
- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2025-01-20
- Deciders: mariushart

## Relationships
### Dependencies
- Enables: All future ADRs
- Influences: Repository structure and documentation practices

### Impact Analysis
- Strength: High
- Scope: Project Structure, Documentation Standards, Development Process
- Reversibility: Medium
- Technical Debt: Low

## Context
As we develop a standardized approach to Architecture Decision Records, we need to ensure our own development process is well-documented and can serve as a practical example of ADR usage. This meta-approach will help validate our templates and provide real-world examples of ADR application.

## Decision Story
- In the context of: developing ADR templates and standards
- Facing concern(s):
  - Need for consistent decision documentation
  - Desire to demonstrate ADR value through example
  - Requirement to validate template usability
- We decided: to use ADRs to document our own ADR template development
- And not: 
  - Use informal documentation
  - Maintain decisions in wiki pages
  - Document decisions in commit messages
- To achieve:
  - Self-documenting development process
  - Practical examples of ADR usage
  - Validation of our template design
- Accepting:
  - Additional overhead in development process
  - Need to maintain consistency between template and usage

## Decision
We will document all significant decisions about the ADR template and process using our own ADR format, storing them in `/docs/adr/` with a consistent naming convention of `adr-{number}-{title}.md`.

## Rationale
- Chosen because:
  - Provides practical validation of our template
  - Creates real-world examples
  - Demonstrates commitment to the process
  - Helps identify template improvements
- Alternatives considered:
  - Wiki documentation: Less structured, harder to version
  - README updates: Lack historical context
  - Commit messages: Too transient and scattered

## Consequences
- Positive:
  - Self-documenting development process
  - Real examples for users
  - Template validation through use
  - Clear decision history
- Negative:
  - Additional maintenance overhead
  - Potential for meta-confusion (ADRs about ADRs)
- Risks:
  - Over-documentation of minor decisions
  - Template changes requiring updates to existing ADRs

## Technical Details
- ADR File Structure:
  - Located in /docs/adr/
  - Numbered sequentially
  - Kebab-case filenames
  - Markdown format
- Required Sections:
  - Metadata
  - Context
  - Decision
  - Consequences
