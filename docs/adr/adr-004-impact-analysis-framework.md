## Metadata
- ID: ADR-004
- Type: ADR

## Relationships
### Dependencies
- Requires: ADR-002 (Template Structure)
- Enhances: ADR-003 (Metadata Fields)

### Impact Analysis
- Strength: High
- Scope: Decision Analysis, Risk Assessment
- Reversibility: Medium
- Technical Debt: Low

## Context
Understanding the impact of architectural decisions is crucial for proper evaluation and planning. We need a structured way to assess and communicate the potential impacts, risks, and dependencies of each architectural decision.

## Decision Story
- In the context of: evaluating architectural decisions
- Facing concern(s):
  - Need for consistent impact assessment
  - Difficulty in comparing decision impacts
  - Requirement for clear dependency tracking
  - Risk assessment standardization
- We decided: to implement a structured impact analysis framework
- And not:
  - Rely on informal impact assessment
  - Use numeric scoring only
  - Omit impact analysis entirely
- To achieve:
  - Consistent impact evaluation
  - Clear communication of consequences
  - Better risk management
  - Dependency tracking
- Accepting:
  - Some subjectivity in assessments
  - Need for regular review and updates
  - Additional documentation overhead

## Decision
We will implement an impact analysis framework with the following components:

1. Strength Assessment:
   - None: No significant impact
   - Low: Minor changes required
   - Medium: Substantial changes needed
   - High: Major system impact

2. Scope Analysis:
   - List of affected areas
   - Cross-cutting concerns
   - Integration points

3. Reversibility Evaluation:
   - None: Cannot be reversed
   - Low: High cost to reverse
   - Medium: Moderate effort to reverse
   - High: Easily reversed

4. Technical Debt Rating:
   - None: No technical debt
   - Low: Minor cleanup needed
   - Medium: Significant refactoring needed
   - High: Major restructuring required

## Rationale
- Chosen because:
  - Provides structured impact assessment
  - Supports decision comparison
  - Enables risk management
  - Facilitates dependency tracking
- Alternatives considered:
  - Numeric scoring: Too rigid and potentially misleading
  - Free-form assessment: Lacks consistency
  - Minimal framework: Insufficient detail

## Consequences
- Positive:
  - Consistent impact evaluation
  - Better risk understanding
  - Clear dependency tracking
  - Improved planning capability
- Negative:
  - Additional documentation effort
  - Potential for analysis paralysis
  - Need for regular reviews
- Risks:
  - Subjective assessments
  - Incomplete analysis
  - Outdated evaluations

## Technical Details
- Assessment Criteria:
  - Clear definitions for each level
  - Examples for each category
  - Regular review requirements
- Documentation Requirements:
  - Impact levels must be justified
  - Dependencies must be explicit
  - Risks must be specific
