# Enterprise Architecture Support in ADR Framework

## Metadata
- ID: ADR-006
- Type: ADR
- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2025-01-20
- Deciders: Repository Maintainers

## Relationships
### Dependencies
- Requires: ADR-005 (ADR Versioning Strategy)
- Enables: ADR-007 (Automated EA Monitoring)
- Influences: ADR-003 (Metadata Fields)

### Impact Analysis
- Strength: High
- Scope: Enterprise Architecture Support
- Reversibility: High
- Technical Debt: Low

## Context
While ADRs primarily serve individual projects, Enterprise Architecture teams need visibility into architectural decisions across the organization. The standardized nature of ADRs provides an opportunity for automated EA oversight without burdening individual projects with enterprise-wide concerns.

## Decision Story
- In the context of: enabling enterprise architecture governance
- Facing concern(s):
  - Need for enterprise-wide architectural oversight
  - Desire to keep project ADRs focused and unburdened
  - Opportunity for automated EA monitoring
  - Support for EA governance processes
- We decided: to ensure ADR framework enables automated EA oversight through standardized formats
- And not:
  - Require projects to track enterprise-wide impacts
  - Create separate ADR formats for EA
  - Impose manual EA tracking requirements
- To achieve:
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - Automated EA oversight capabilities
  - Minimal project overhead
  - Maximum EA visibility
- Accepting:
  - EA teams need to develop monitoring tools
  - Standard format must be strictly followed
  - Some automated analysis limitations

## Decision
We will ensure our ADR framework supports EA oversight by:

1. Standardizing Project ADR Structure:
   ```
   project/
   ├── docs/
   │   └── adr/              # Standard location
   │       ├── NNNN-*.md     # Consistent naming
   │       └── index.md      # Optional catalog
   ```

2. Enforcing Machine-Readable Format:
   ```markdown
   ---
   id: ADR-NNN
   status: [status]
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   ---
   # Title
   
   ## Standard Sections...
   ```

3. Supporting EA Repository Creation:
   ```
   enterprise-architecture/
   ├── collectors/           # ADR monitoring tools
   │   ├── git-hooks/       
   │   └── analyzers/
   ├── views/
   │   ├── tech-radar/      # Technology tracking
   │   ├── patterns/        # Pattern usage
   │   └── impact/          # Change impact
   └── policies/            # Architecture rules
   ```

## Rationale
- Chosen because:
  - Enables automated monitoring
  - Maintains clean separation of concerns
  - Supports systematic analysis
  - Minimizes project overhead
- Alternatives considered:
  - Manual tracking: Too error-prone
  - Project-side EA fields: Unnecessary burden
  - Custom EA formats: Added complexity

## Consequences
- Positive:
  - Projects remain focused on their concerns
  - EA gets automated oversight
  - Standardized analysis possible
  - Real-time architecture visibility
- Negative:
  - Strict format requirements
  - EA tooling needed
  - Format validation overhead
- Risks:
  - Format deviation
  - Analysis accuracy
  - Tool maintenance

## Technical Details
- Format Requirements:
  - Strict front-matter format
  - Required section headers
  - Consistent file location
  - Standard naming convention

- Support for Analysis:
  - Machine-readable sections
  - Clear status tracking
  - Explicit relationships
  - Version information

- EA Tool Requirements:
  - Git integration
  - Format validation
  - Pattern detection
  - Impact analysis
