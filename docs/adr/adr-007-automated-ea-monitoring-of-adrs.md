# Automated EA Monitoring of ADRs

## Metadata
- ID: ADR-007
- Type: ADR
- Status: Proposed
- Date: 2025-01-20
- Deciders: Repository Maintainers

## Relationships
### Dependencies
- Requires: ADR-006 (Enterprise Architecture Support)
- Requires: ADR-003 (Metadata Fields)
- Enhances: ADR-005 (ADR Versioning Strategy)

### Impact Analysis
- Strength: High
- Scope: Enterprise Architecture, Automation
- Reversibility: High
- Technical Debt: Low

## Context
The standardized format of ADRs in software repositories creates an opportunity for automated Enterprise Architecture oversight. By monitoring changes to ADR folders across repositories, EA teams can automatically collect, analyze, and respond to architectural decisions throughout the organization.

## Decision Story
- In the context of: enabling automated EA oversight
- Facing concern(s):
  - Manual tracking of architectural decisions
  - Delayed EA awareness of architectural changes
  - Consistency of architecture across systems
  - Need for proactive EA involvement
- We decided: to ensure ADR format supports automated monitoring and analysis
- And not:
  - Require manual EA tracking
  - Create separate EA notification systems
  - Modify project workflows
- To achieve:
  - Automated EA awareness
  - Real-time architecture monitoring
  - Proactive EA involvement
  - Consistent analysis capabilities
- Accepting:
  - Need for EA tooling development
  - Potential false positives in analysis
  - Tool maintenance overhead

## Decision
We will support automated EA monitoring by:

1. Git Integration Requirements:
   - Standard ADR path: `/docs/adr/`
   - Consistent file naming: `adr-NNN-title.md`
   - Required front-matter format
   - Structured markdown sections

2. Event Detection Points:
   ```
   - Pull Request Creation:
     - New ADR added
     - ADR status changed
     - ADR superseded
   - Branch Protection:
     - ADR validation rules
     - Required EA review for specific patterns
   ```

3. Analysis Capabilities:
   ```
   - Technology Radar tracking
   - Dependency analysis
   - Pattern detection
   - Architecture compliance
   - Decision impact assessment
   ```

4. Response Mechanisms:
   ```
   - Automated PR comments
   - EA notification routing
   - Impact analysis reports
   - Compliance checks
   ```

## Rationale
- Chosen because:
  - Enables proactive EA involvement
  - Automates manual tracking
  - Supports consistent analysis
  - Minimizes project overhead
- Alternatives considered:
  - Manual tracking: Too slow and error-prone
  - Separate reporting: Additional overhead
  - Project-side automation: Duplicated effort

## Consequences
- Positive:
  - Real-time EA awareness
  - Automated analysis
  - Consistent oversight
  - Early EA involvement
- Negative:
  - Tool development required
  - False positive handling
  - Analysis rule maintenance
- Risks:
  - Tool reliability
  - Analysis accuracy
  - Performance impact
